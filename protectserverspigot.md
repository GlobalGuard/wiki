# Paper/Spigot Configuration
If you would like IP's to be forwarded to your server you need to download the Proxy Protocol plugin.
<br>
You can download the plugin by going to our Discord <a href="https://discord.gg/WXUnhNbNER">https://discord.gg/WXUnhNbNER</a>

Once it is added make sure to restart your server. However we recommend using BungeeCord.
